I never thought you would read this secret paragraph here. I'm glad you didn't give up on finding the key (hope so, but I believe in you). The actual paragraph is as follows:
I appreciate that you have taught me a lot over the years even though you might blame me sometimes haha ​​but don't worry I'm trying to be better too. Hope you can do well in your DSE examination. I don't have too high expectations, I just hope you can relax and not be too depressed and tired. We’ll keep in touch so I won’t write such a long and boring post. Good luck!
