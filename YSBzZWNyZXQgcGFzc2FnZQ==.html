I never thought you would actually cracked the key, but here you are! I’m really glad you didn’t give up on searching for it (or at least I hope so). It means a lot to me that you took the time to look. <br>

Over the years, you have taught me lots of things. I know there have been times when I may have frustrated you (haha, sorry about that). Even when things weren’t perfect, I’ve been learning and growing, and I’m trying to be better too. <br>

As you towards your DSE examination, I really hope you can take care of yourself, both mentally and physically. I know how much pressure this exam can bring, still I don’t want you to get too stressed or overwhelmed. <br>

At the end of the day, your well-being matters more than any score. I hope you can approach this with a calm mind, do your best, and not be too hard on yourself. <br>

We’ll definitely keep in touch, so I won’t turn this into an overly long and dull letter la. Wishing you all the luck in the world—go smash it!
